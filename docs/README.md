## What is Evo?

Evo is an advanced neural network-based evolutionary sandbox where AI agents evolve through natural selection. Agents navigate an infinite 2D world, sense their environment using raycasting, and make autonomous decisions using neural networks.

Watch species emerge, compete for resources, and evolve over generations in real-time!
