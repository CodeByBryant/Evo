# Evo - Advanced Neural Evolution Sandbox

## Overview

Evo is a cutting-edge neural network-based evolutionary sandbox featuring **full genetic algorithms**, **infinite scrollable worlds**, **DNA visualization**, and **real-time evolution tracking**. Built with **React + TypeScript**, this project lets you watch AI agents evolve through natural selection in an endless 2D ecosystem.

## Recent Major Update (November 19, 2025)

### Version 3.2: "Territorial Clusters" 🏝️🧬

Revolutionary territorial evolution system with isolated food clusters:

#### New Features (November 19, 2025)
1. **Territorial Food Clusters**
   - Configurable number of isolated circular zones (2-10+ clusters)
   - Food spawns and respawns only within assigned clusters
   - Geometric positioning in polygon patterns (triangle/square/pentagon/etc)

   - Each cluster marked with dashed white boundary

2. **ClusterManager System**
   - Polygon geometry calculations for n-sided layouts
   - Configurable cluster radius and spacing
   - Cluster-aware food and agent spawning
   - Food tracks original cluster for proper respawn location
   - One species per cluster at initialization

3. **Spatial Distribution**
   - Base-plus-remainder algorithm for fair resource distribution
   - Agents distributed across all clusters evenly
   - Food distributed with remainder handling
   - Camera auto-centers on first cluster for immediate visibility

4. **Gene Pool Evolution Integration**
   - Continuous evolution without resets between generations
   - Gene pool resurrection maintains diversity
   - Species can evolve in isolation within their clusters
   - Natural migration possible for high-fitness agents

5. **Performance Optimizations**

### Version 3.1: "Genealogy & Fitness Enhancement" 🧬📊

Latest enhancements to the evolution simulator:

#### New Features (November 18, 2025)

## How Evolution Works

### Lifecycle
1. **Initialization**: Population spawns with random genomes
2. **Simulation**: Agents move, sense, eat food, gain fitness
3. **Aging**: Energy depletes, agents age, some die
4. **Reproduction**: High-energy agents reproduce
5. **Selection**: At generation end, top % survive
6. **New Generation**: Survivors create offspring via crossover + mutation

### Fitness Metrics
- Food eaten (+1 per food)
- Survival time (longer = fitter)
- Energy management

### Mutation
- Gaussian noise added to weights/biases
- Configurable mutation rate (0-30%)
- Clamped to prevent explosion

### Crossover
- Random selection from each parent's genes
- 50/50 probability per weight/bias
- Creates genetic diversity

## Configuration

All evolution parameters are adjustable in real-time:

```typescript
EvolutionConfig {
  generationTime: 1000,        // Steps per generation
  selectionRate: 0.3,           // Top 30% survive
  mutationRate: 0.05,           // 5% mutation chance
  populationSize: 30,           // Target population
  reproductionThreshold: 80,    // Energy needed to reproduce
  maxAge: 500                   // Maximum lifespan
}
```
